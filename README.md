# Walmart Sales Analysis

*This project aims to explore the Walmart Sales data to understand top performing branches and products, sales trend of of different products, customer behaviour. The aims is to study how sales strategies can be improved and optimized.*

In the initial phase of **data wrangling**, we meticulously inspect the dataset to identify any NULL or missing values. Through various data replacement techniques, we ensure the integrity of our data. Following this, we proceed to build a robust database, creating tables and inserting the refined data.

During this process, we intentionally set constraints to eliminate NULL values from our database, ensuring data consistency. Subsequently, we engage in feature engineering to enhance our dataset's richness. By generating new columns such as 'time_of_day,' depicting sales trends across Morning, Afternoon, and Evening, and 'day_name,' indicating the busiest days of the week for each branch, we aim to gain deeper insights into sales patterns.

Additionally, the inclusion of the 'month_name' column aids in analyzing sales and profit trends throughout the year. This meticulous approach facilitates the identification of peak sales periods and profitable months.

Moving forward, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** serves as a pivotal stage in our project, enabling us to address specific business inquiries and goals effectively.

In conclusion, by meticulously executing data wrangling, database construction, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis, we aim to **extract meaningful insights** to drive informed business decisions and enhance overall performance.

The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition.

The primary objective was to delve into Walmart's sales data, aiming to comprehend the various factors influencing sales across its branches. Through this analysis, we seek to address pertinent business inquiries, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the company's performance.
